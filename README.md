# Speech Recognition Project  
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to recognize and transcribe speech into text. Follow these steps to run the code in **VS Code** with a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Dataset Description  
The dataset used for this project contains audio recordings and corresponding text transcriptions. Key features include:  

- **Audio Samples**: Speech data in various formats (e.g., WAV, MP3).  
- **Transcriptions**: Textual representation of spoken words.  
- **Sample Rate**: The rate at which audio data is captured.  
- **Speaker Metadata**: Information such as gender, age, and accent (if available).  

## Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed on your computer:  

- **VS Code**  
- **Python Extension** for VS Code  
- **Jupyter Extension** for VS Code  

Create a Python environment and install the following packages:  

- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`  
- `librosa` (for audio processing)  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `speechrecognition`  
- `pyaudio` (optional, for real-time speech recognition)  

### Installing Dependencies  
You can install the required packages using the terminal in VS Code:  
```bash  
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn librosa scikit-learn speechrecognition pyaudio  
```  

## Getting Started  

1. **Open VS Code**.  
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to save this project.  
3. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code.  
4. Clone the repository or download the project files:  
   ```bash  
   git clone <GitHub Repository Link>  
   ```  
   Or download the ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.  
5. Open the folder in VS Code.  
6. Inside the folder, locate the `Speech_Recognition.ipynb` file and open it using the Jupyter extension in VS Code.

## Running the Code  

1. Run each cell in the Jupyter Notebook (`Speech_Recognition.ipynb`) within VS Code.  
2. The code will handle audio data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, and building a machine learning model for speech recognition.  
3. Review the outputs and model performance as you proceed through the notebook.  

## Dependencies  
Ensure the following Python packages are installed in your environment:

- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`  
- `librosa`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `speechrecognition`  
- `pyaudio`  

Enjoy exploring the world of speech recognition with this project!
